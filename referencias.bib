	abstract = {Given the large deficits in many OECD countries in recent years, and the resulting sharp rise in the public debt, it is important to determine the economic and political forces leading to such large deficits. We find only partial support for the ‘equilibrium approach to fiscal policy’, which assumes that tax rates are set over time in order to minimize the excess burden of taxation. We suggest that in several countries the slow rate at which the post-'73 fiscal deficits were reduced resulted from the difficulties of political management in coalition governments. There is a clear tendency for larger deficits in countries characterized by a short average tenure of government and by the presence of many political parties in a ruling coalition.},

The process leading to stabilization becomes a "war of attrition," each group attempting to wait the others out and stabilization occurring only when one group concedes and bears a disproportionate share of the burden. We solve for the expected time of stabilization in a model of "rational" delay and relate it to several political and economic variables. We motivate this approach and its results by comparison to historical and current episodes.},

Using a panel of Spanish municipalities, along with a close-elections regression discontinuity design, we find that single-party majorities run budgets with a 1.5\% point larger primary surplus than that of coalitions. In addition, we show that lower deficits are driven mainly by single-party majority governments’ capacity to raise more revenues. These findings are robust to several model specifications.},

The investigation employs both continuity- and randomization-based regression discontinuity methods to accommodate the endogeneity of council size and to identify its causal effects on local government spending, service delivery, and own-source revenue mobilization. Many studies have examined the influence of increasing legislature size on expenditures, but no consensus has emerged on the direction of impacts. Moreover, interpretation of the efficiency of derived spending effects has remained elusive and reliant on ad hoc theorizing. This is the first study to examine the causal impact of council size on service outcomes, thereby facilitating an empirically based understanding of efficiency effects. The study finds that increasing legislature size negatively affects local government total and capital spending. The investigation also shows that rising legislature size has a negative influence on citizen access to public services. Finally, the examination offers evidence to suggest that an increasing number of legislators have no impact on local own-source revenues. Taken together the results imply a decline in local efficiency: residents pay the same amount in taxes but receive fewer services. The findings in this investigation contradict recent theoretical predictions and empirical results from other research.},

(J Polit Econ 89(4):642–664, 1981), whose “law of 1/n” posits that an increase in the number of elected representatives always leads to an increase in public spending. Because elected politicians regard the tax base as a common pool from which they can finance specific projects for their constituencies, and these specific constituencies internalize the full benefits of the projects, but only bear a fraction of the costs (projects are financed from the common tax base), fiscal inefficiency will increase with the number of representatives. In this paper, I test the validity of the “law of 1/n” using a dataset of 9325 German municipalities between 2008 and 2010. Through the application of a regression discontinuity design, many of the methodological pitfalls of previous studies can be avoided and a valid estimation of the causal effect of legislature size on public spending for German municipalities can be determined. The results do not corroborate the positive findings of previous studies, which generally supported the implications of the “law of 1/n”. For the years 2008–2010, I find a negative effect of legislature size on public spending in German municipal councils.},

We first define the notion of fragmentation of fiscal policy-making as the degree to which the costs of a dollar of aggregate expenditure are internalized by individual decision-makers. Empirically, this notion has two key logical components: the number of decision-makers and the rules of the game, or the budget process. In turn, the number of decision makers can refer to the number of parties in a coalition, or the number of ministers in the cabinet. We test all these determinants against each other, and against perhaps the oldest explanation of all, ideology. We show that cabinet size and, to a lesser degree, coalition size and ideology, are significant and robust determinants of fiscal outcomes. In particular, transfers are the budget items most affected by these factors.},

There are two competing perspectives about the consequences of coalition governments for the size of public expenditures. The most common argument is that government spending increases under coalition governments, compared with one-party governments. Another line of thought contends that coalition governments are often stalled in the status quo due to the veto power of each member. Our analysis of public spending in 33 parliamentary democracies between 1972 and 2000 confirms the latter argument that coalition governments have a status quo bias. We find, particularly, that single-party governments are apt to modify the budget according to the current fiscal condition, which enables them to increase or decrease spending more flexibly. By contrast, coalition governments find it difficult not only to decrease spending under difficult fiscal conditions but also to increase it even under a more favorable context, because each member of the coalition has a veto power.},

To identify a causal impact of preference votes, we exploit a regression discontinuity design around the threshold of winning the most preference votes on a party list. In our main case, Sweden, these narrow “primary winners” are at least 50\% more likely to become local party leaders than their runners-up. Across individual politicians, the primary effect is present only for politicians who hold the first few positions on the list and when the preference-vote winner and runner-up have similar competence levels.

Indeed, effects on public deficits of the sociopolitical variables tend to be smaller in countries with better institutional arrangements. Conversely, the sociopolitical polarization has very strong effects on deficits in the presence of poor institutions.

	abstract = {This article studies the motivations of party leaders to form “minimum winning” electoral coalitions—alliances that cease to be winning if one member is subtracted. In Brazil, concurrent elections stimulate political actors' coordination, and electoral alliances are allowed. In 2002 and 2006, moreover, the Electoral Supreme Court obliged those parties with presidential candidates to replicate this electoral arrangement in the district. Under “verticalization,” parties with presidential candidates could not form alliances with rival parties in the concurrent legislative and gubernatorial elections. Verticalization arguably pushed party leaders to form minimum winning electoral coalitions. This new rule forced them to reconsider the contributions of each possible ally in the elections for president, federal deputy, and governor. Examining the elections from 1998 to 2006, this study finds that under verticalization, while parties did form more electoral coalitions with those partners they considered crucial to win, they did so at the expense of policy.},

This article shows that a move from closed-list to open-list competition is likely to be more favorable to parties with more internal disagreement on salient issues; this is because voters who might have voted for a unified party under closed lists may be drawn to specific candidates within internally divided parties under open lists. The study provides experimental evidence of this phenomenon in a hypothetical European Parliament election in the UK, in which using an open-list ballot would shift support from UKIP (the Eurosceptic party) to Eurosceptic candidates of the Conservative Party. The findings suggest that open-list ballots could restrict support for parties that primarily mobilize on a single issue.},

If anything, fiscal deficits were somewhat higher under single-party minority governments with organized support of opposition parties than under majority governments especially.

However, empirical evidence on the matter for developing countries is scant and mixed. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the impact of political competition and electoral participation on the fiscal performance of 1,098 Colombian municipalities during four government periods (2000-2015). Using a fixed effect panel data model, we find a significant positive relationship between political competition and electoral participation and a composite fiscal performance index. To be more precise, our results indicate that municipalities that have a lower concentration of council seats in the hands of few parties (i.e. a lower Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) and higher voter turnout rates tend to perform better. These results are explained by the positive impact of political competition and electoral participation on operating expenses, local revenue generation, investment and savings. Overall, these findings support political accountability theories, which argue that electoral participation and political competition incentivize career-concerned politicians to perform well and to reduce rent-extraction behavior.},

We address this question by analyzing high-quality data on budgetary procedures and fiscal performance over a 25-year period in Norwegian local governments. This long time period allows exploiting substantial variation in budgetary procedures across time and space. The results show that administrative delegation decreases fiscal deficits as a share of current revenues. Compared to procedures relying on political coordination or the traditional ‘bottom-up’ procedure, deficits are approximately 0.3 percentage points lower on average under administrative delegation. Still, this effect is conditional upon the presence of minority governments and fails to materialize when the mayor enjoys majority support in the local council. Our results thus indicate that administrative delegation in budgetary processes may constitute an important tool to alleviate poor fiscal performance arising due to political coordination failures and weak political decision-making.},

I argue that such coalitions have incentives to internalise the future costs of debt accumulation and reach credible agreements to balance their constituencies’ ﬁscal preferences. Moreover, sustaining broad coalitions should have electoral advantages to implementing controversial economic reforms, thus resulting in lower debt increases compared not only with less durable coalitions but also with single-party governments. Comparing 36 economically advanced democracies between (up to) 1962 and 2013, I estimate the effects of coalitions’ cooperation prospects on the dynamics of public debt. The ﬁndings indicate that long time horizons can help coalitions to overcome intertemporal coordination problems and to reach speciﬁc policy goals.},

Empirically, we find that initiatives increase the size of the public sector under single-party governments, but this positive relationship disappears as coalition size increases. In contrast, we find that financial referendums slow down the growth of public spending, while law referendums are not systematically associated with public spending. Finally, we find that the relationship between direct democratic institutions, coalition size and public spending does not change over time despite the long period under investigation.},

Political economy suggests conflicts of interest may lie behind the emergence of deficits: (1) Opportunistic politicians generate deficits to win elections, even in conflict with general welfare; (2) Conflicts of interests between politicians’ partisan preferences create incentives for (at least some) incumbents to run deficits and (3) Conflicts of interest between different social groups or regions generate tensions in the allocation of government resources leading to overspending. This paper reviews these different strands of the literature. It also covers contributions that highlight the crucial role of budget institutions in determining the extent to which the political motivations to generate deficits are indeed translated into poor fiscal outcomes.

This setup has striking macroeconomic implications. Transfers are higher than a benevolent planner would choose them to be; ﬁscal deﬁcits emerge even when there are no reasons for intertemporal smoothing, and in the long run government debt tends to be excessively high; peculiar time proﬁles for transfers can emerge, with high net transfers early on giving rise to high taxes later on. © 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Our analysis suggests that supermajority rule, despite the claim that it restrains excessive spending, increases the 1/n effect, because qualified majorities require logrolling to attract additional members. Using data from US states from 1970 to 2007, we find that the adoption of a supermajority rule has a robust, worsening effect on the fiscal commons problem identified by the law of 1/n.},

Their proposition is currently known as the “law of 1/ ” and has been widely cited by scholars in political science and public administration. However, recent studies have questioned the validity of the theory. In this paper, we estimate the ﬁrst meta-analysis of the relationship between the number of legislators and public spending. Based on a sample of 26 empirical studies, we ﬁnd little eﬀect of legislature size on government budgets. The available evidence suggests that, if such an eﬀect exists, it is driven by an increase in the upper chamber, but there is considerable heterogeneity in the results. Our meta-regressions also indicate that study coeﬃcients vary signiﬁcantly according to modelling speciﬁcations, such as estimation method or variable selection.},

	abstract = {In order to evaluate a fiscal common-pool problem, this paper focuses on the relationship between local government council size and its expenditure. Generally, local councilors internalize the benefit of public projects targeted at their political jurisdictions, but underestimate and prefer to externalize the cost of public projects due to the national subsidy system. When council sizes become larger, their expenditure might be larger because of the selfish behavior of local council members. This paper estimates the positive effect of local council size on local government expenditure using a dataset of 13,989 municipalities in Japan over a period of 6 years. In Japan, local council size is a deterministic and discontinuous function of municipal population size under legal rules. We pay attention to this exogenous discontinuity and apply a regression discontinuity design to consider an endogeneity bias. The results show that the larger the size of the local council the larger the size of expenditure they undertake. In particular, we find that growing small municipalities tend to increase their expenditures, so that for example, 1\% increases in local council size lead to about 1.2\% increases of expenditures by small municipalities. Our results show that the fiscal common-pool problem is produced in small municipalities.},

This research tests the law of 1/n in the Portuguese local context and finds that the law fails to apply. We suggest an alternative measure—the density of representation—to assess the impact of the rules of city council representation on local public expenditures. Density of representation is defined as the number of elected officials in the city council divided by city population. We find an S-shaped relationship between the density of representation and the level of local government expenditures. The level of municipal spending initially declines with increases in the density of representation, reflecting an increase in the ability of constituents to monitor their elected representatives. At higher levels of representation density, the relationship becomes positive, suggesting that the dynamics of the budgetary commons become salient. The relationship becomes negative again for extremely high density of representation owing to increases in the transaction costs of legislative decision-making. This paper discusses the implications of our findings for the reform of local government institutions and the rules of political representation.},

As for the law of 1/n, the effect of council size on total government expenditures is not significant.

First, we show that both intra- and inter-party ideological dispersion matter in explaining the level of sub-national public spending. Therefore, it is improper to consider parties as monolithic entities. We also show that ideological dispersion matters especially for current expenditures, and not so much for investment expenditures. To do so, we construct a panel database (2003–2010) comprising data from a survey that quantifies the policy preferences of party members who were candidates in Swiss elections.},

However, empirical tests of this theory have produced a pattern of divergent findings. The positive relationship between seats and spending appears to hold consistently for unicameral legislatures and for upper chambers in bicameral legislatures but not for lower chambers. We bridge this gap between theory and empirics by extending Weingast et al.'s model to account for bicameralism in the context of a Baron–Ferejohn bargaining game. Our comparative statics predict, and empirical data from U.S. state legislatures corroborate, that the size of the upper chamber (

Mais especificamente, assume-se que a ocorrência de superávits e déficits fiscais não deve ser tomada como um evento puramente aleatório e, alternativamente, assume-se a existência de um primeiro estágio que determina a ocorrência de um superávit ou de um déficit fiscal. Os resultados corrigidos para a presença do viés amostral indicam que saldos fiscais positivos e negativos são parcialmente influenciados pelas características fiscais dos municípios, bem como pela estrutura demográfica da população. Contudo, suas características políticas pouco influenciam o resultado fiscal.},

O resultado encontrado confirma a literatura teórica existente, que sugere que a reeleição funciona como um instrumento de controle dos eleitores sobre o comportamento fiscal dos políticos eleitos para cargos do Executivo, bem como chama a atenção para o risco de maior deterioração das finanças públicas subnacionais caso a reeleição seja proibida no país.},

Despite the importance of institutional design for democratic governance, the effect of legislative features on citizen welfare remains little understood. In this article, we use a formal model to show that increasing legislature size improves public goods delivery. We argue that changes in bargaining costs depend on whether additional legislators share the executive’s party afﬁliation: More opposition members reduce the equilibrium public goods provision, while more government-aligned members increase it. We test this theory by exploiting sharp discontinuities in city-council size in Brazil. We show that an additional city councilor has a 91\% chance of belonging to the mayoral coalition, and this signiﬁcantly improves primary school enrollment and infant mortality rates. To explore possible mechanisms, we surveyed 174 former city councilors and analyzed 346,553 bills proposed between 2005 and 2008. This article has implications for the design of representative institutions.},

Larger parties thus internalize more costs than small parties because they represent more groups. This argument implies that the public sector should be larger the more parties there are in the government coalition. We test this prediction using yearly time‐series cross‐sectional data from 1970 to 1998 in 17 European countries. We find that increasing the number of parties in government increases the fraction of GDP accounted for by government spending by close to half a percentage point, or more than one billion current dollars in the typical year. We find little support for the alternative claim that the number of legislative parties affects the size of the public sector, except via the number of parties in government

In our theory members of the legislature act noncooperatively in choosing strategies to serve their own districts, explicitly taking into account the strategies members adopt in response to the sequential nature of proposal making and voting. The model permits the characterization of a legislative equilibrium reflecting the structure of the legislature and also allows consideration of the choice of elements of that structure in a context in which the standard, institution-free model of social choice theory yields no equilibrium.},

	abstract = {We inventory more than 150 studies of distributive politics in more than three dozen countries other than the United States. We organize existing studies under two theories: theories of democratic accountability and theories of government responsiveness. Studies that concern democratic accountability conceptualize distributive allocations as attempts by politicians to protect themselves electorally by targeting speciﬁc groups of voters. We identify four subsets: (a) studies of whether politicians target goods to core or swing voters; (b) studies of general political favoritism in targeting government goods; (c) studies of whether goods are disbursed according to the electoral cycle; and (d ) studies of whether elected ofﬁcials gain votes from the disbursement of government goods. We illustrate each with examples from the literature. We then discuss distributive politics as responsiveness to the median voter. This perspective entails a focus on the redistributive consequences of government policy and investigates whether special interests capture a disproportionate share of goods coming from government. To illustrate the utility of both perspectives, we analyze original data on electricity provision in India’s largest state.},

            Resumen Este artículo ofrece una teoría para explicar de qué forma los partidos políticos influyen en las inversiones discrecionales de los ministerios en Brasil. Contrario a estudios anteriores que asumen que presidentes centralizan las decisiones de asignación del Gobierno Federal, aquí argumento que ellos y ellas comparten dichas decisiones con otros partidos cuando ofrecen ministerios al formar coaliciones de gobierno. Una vez que asumen un ministerio, los partidos pasan a ejercer influencia y a adquirir experticia sobre las inversiones gestionadas por sus despachos, lo que, a su vez, incentiva a sus correligionarios locales a pedir, y también a recibir, más recursos de estos. Con datos que abarcan más de 20 años de transferencias discrecionales de ministerios a alcaldías en Brasil y a partir de un diseño de diferencias triples, se da soporte a la teoría. En particular, los resultados muestran que los alcaldes demandan y reciben hasta un tercio adicional de transferencias que provienen de ministerios dirigidos por sus correligionarios, efecto que se torna mayor en años electorales y en ministerios que invierten más en infraestructura local, sin haber diferencias entre el partido en la Presidencia y los partidarios de la coalición. Por otro lado, no hay evidencia de que los ministros manipulen directamente la burocracia para beneficiar a sus aliados. En general, estos resultados indican que los partidos políticos extraen beneficios no programáticos al ocupar ministerios en Brasil.

            Résumé Cet article propose une théorie pour expliquer comment les partis politiques influencent les investissements discrétionnaires des ministères au Brésil. Contrairement aux études précédentes qui supposent que les présidents centralisent les décisions d’attribution du gouvernement fédéral, je soutiens qu’ils les partagent avec d’autres partis lorsqu’ils offrent des ministères lors de la formation de coalitions gouvernementales. Une fois en charge d’un ministère, les partis commencent à exercer une influence et à acquérir une expertise sur les investissements gérés par leurs ministères, ce qui, à son tour, encourage leurs coreligionnaires locaux à demander, et aussi à recevoir, plus de ressources de leur part. Les données couvrant plus de 20 ans de transferts discrétionnaires des ministères aux municipalités au Brésil et une conception à triples différences appuient la théorie. En particulier, les résultats montrent que les maires demandent et reçoivent jusqu’à un tiers de transferts supplémentaires des ministères dirigés par des coreligionnaires, un effet qui est plus important les années électorales et dans les ministères qui investissent davantage dans les infrastructures locales, quel que soit le parti à la présidence et les partenaires de la coalition. D’un autre côté, rien ne prouve que les ministres manipulent directement la bureaucratie au profit des alliés. Dans l’ensemble, ces résultats indiquent que les partis politiques tirent des avantages non programmatiques de l’occupation des ministères au Brésil.

            Abstract This paper provides a theory to explain how political parties influence cabinet portfolios’ targeted discretionary investments in Brazil. Contrary to previous studies that claim presidents centralize allocative decisions for electoral gains, I argue that they share them with coalition parties when they offer portfolios to obtain legislative support. Conversely, coalition parties acquire influence and expertise on portfolio-specific spending, incentivizing local incumbents to request more transfers from portfolios held by co-partisan ministers. Data covering more than twenty years of discretionary investments from cabinet portfolios to municipalities in Brazil and a triple-difference design support the theory. Results show that mayors demand and receive up to one-third more transfers from portfolios administered by co-partisan politicians, an effect that benefits both presidents’ and coalition parties alike. In addition, this effect is greater in election years and among portfolios responsible for local infrastructure. I find no evidence that ministers or their staff directly manipulate the bureaucracy to favor co-partisan mayors. These findings indicate that political parties reap non-programmatic benefits from joining government coalitions in Brazil.},

Using a regression-discontinuity design, we find no effect of left-wing mayors on the size of the city government. We find a modest but robust positive effect of approximately 0.6 percentage points on the social expenditures share, which translates in a small (approximately 1 percent) increase in social expenditure per capita. The impact of left-wing mayors on social spending is stronger in the 2004–2008 ‘boom years’, for lame-duck mayors and in cities receiving oil windfalls. These results suggest that Brazilian parties attempt to shape the allocation of municipal resources to favor their respective electoral bases but their ability to do so is severely limited by factors such as institutional constraints and re-election concerns.},

For a rich class of dynamic causal effects, we provide a nonparametric estimator that is unbiased over the randomization distribution and derive its finite population limiting distribution as either the sample size or the duration of the experiment increases. We develop two methods for inference: a conservative test for weak null hypotheses and an exact randomization test for sharp null hypotheses. We further analyze the finite population probability limit of linear fixed effects estimators. These commonly‐used estimators do not recover a causally interpretable estimand if there are dynamic causal effects and serial correlation in the assignments, highlighting the value of our proposed estimator.},

To surmount these restrictions, we present the dynamic multivariate panel model (DMPM) that supports time-varying, time-invariant, and individual-specific effects, multiple responses across a wide variety of distributions, and arbitrary dependency structures of lagged responses of any order. We formally demonstrate how DMPM facilitates causal inference within the structural causal modeling framework and we take a Bayesian approach for the estimation of the posterior distributions of the model parameters and causal effects of interest. We demonstrate the use of DMPM by applying the approach to both real and synthetic data.},

In this paper, we show that while causal effects are not point identified under manipulation, one can derive sharp bounds under a general model that covers a wide range of empirical patterns. The extent of manipulation, which determines the width of the bounds, is inferred from the data in our setup. Our approach therefore does not require making a binary decision regarding whether manipulation occurs or not, and can be used to deliver manipulation‐robust inference in settings where manipulation is conceivable, but not obvious from the data. We use our methods to study the disincentive effect of unemployment insurance on (formal) reemployment in Brazil, and show that our bounds remain informative, despite the fact that manipulation has a sizable effect on our estimates of causal parameters.},

It makes use of original data from semi-structured open interviews with a non-representative sample of 112 councilmembers from twelve municipalities of Minas Gerais, Brazil. By means of qualitative analysis, respondents were classified according to three types, according to their main representation strategy: “legislator”, who is more dedicated to the office's formal functions; “fundseeker”, who prioritizes the servicing of voters’ requests of a collective nature; and the paternalist, who prioritizes servicing requests of a private nature. Based on the theoretical literature on clientelism, it offers explanatory hypotheses about councilmembers’ representation strategies, which are tested statistically using a multinomial probit model. The results suggest that these strategies are qualitatively distinct and that the probability of observing the paternalist type is higher in small municipalities, increasing on the sharpening of political competition and decreasing on electoral volatility. There is also weak evidence that this probability decreases with the councilmember's years of schooling and her time in office.},

            In many countries, important features of municipal government (such as the electoral system, mayors' salaries, and the number of councillors) depend on whether the municipality is above or below arbitrary population thresholds. Several papers have used a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to measure the effects of these threshold‐based policies on political and economic outcomes. Using evidence from France, Germany, and Italy, we highlight two common pitfalls that arise in exploiting population‐based policies (compound treatment and sorting), and we provide guidance for detecting and addressing these pitfalls. Even when these problems are present, population‐threshold RDD may be the best available research design for studying the effects of certain policies and political institutions.},

These effects are more pronounced among municipalities with less access to information and where the likelihood of judicial punishment is lower.

Data from legislative electoral disputes at the municipal level in both elections were used, along with statistical techniques such as cluster analysis and ordinary least squares regression. The results indicate that, on average, there was a reduction in the ENP in Brazilian municipal chambers after the prohibition of proportional coalitions. However, the intensity of this reduction was greater in municipalities where parties were more intensely allied in the legislative competition. These data demonstrate that the configuration of the political competition market in previous elections is relevant for analyzing the degree of fragmentation observed in future elections conducted under new rules.},

            RÉSUMÉ Bien que le maire occupe le poste électif le plus important dans les municipalités brésiliennes, son rôle nécessite un soutien législatif pour mettre en œuvre son programme. Dans cet article, on examine certaines ressources que les candidatures des candidats à la mairie mobilisent pour obtenir le plus grand potentiel de soutien législatif possible. On part de deux possibilités: ou le candidat élu transfère sa popularité à ses partisans dans le différend proportionnel; ou il s’associe avec plusieurs partis. La première option est basée sur l’effet coattail; la seconde, sur les aspects institutionnels suivants: fragmentation du législatif et concentration des candidats à l’exécutif. Forts des données des coalitions électorales municipales, nous avons enquêté sur cinq élections (2000-2016). Nos résultats suggèrent que tant la popularité transférée par le maire élu que le nombre de partis de la coalition majoritaire ont un impact positif sur le potentiel de soutien législatif. Enfin, ils indiquent qu’il n’y a pas d’interaction entre ces deux effets, démontrant que les deux stratégies sont des alternatives l’une à l’autre.

            ABSTRACT Although the mayor holds the most important elective office in Brazilian municipalities, his role requires legislative support to implement its agenda. In this article, we analyze some resources that mayoral candidates who have been elected mobilized to obtain the greatest potential for legislative support. We started from two possibilities: either the elected candidate transfers his popularity to his supporters in the proportional dispute; or if he forms a coalition with several parties. The first option is based on the coattail effect; the second, in the following institutional aspects: fragmentation in the Legislative and concentration of candidates in the Executive. Using municipal electoral coalition data, we investigated five elections (2000-2016). Our results suggest that both the popularity transferred by the elected mayor and the number of parties in the majority coalition positively affect the potential for legislative support. Finally, the data indicate that there is no interaction between these two effects, demonstrating that both strategies are unrelated alternatives.

            RESUMEN Aunque el alcalde ostenta el cargo electivo más importante en los municipios brasileños, su función demanda del apoyo legislativo para implementar su agenda. En este artículo, analizamos algunos recursos que movilizan las propuestas de los alcaldes electos para obtener el mayor potencial de apoyo legislativo posible. Partimos de dos posibilidades: o el candidato electo transfiere su popularidad a sus partidarios en la disputa en el sistema proporcional; o se asocia con varios partidos. La primera opción se sustenta en el efecto coattail; la segunda, en los siguientes aspectos institucionales: fragmentación en el Legislativo y concentración de candidatos en el Ejecutivo. Amparados por datos municipales de coalición electoral, investigamos cinco elecciones (2000-2016). Nuestros resultados sugieren que tanto la popularidad transferida por el alcalde electo, como el número de partidos en la coalición mayoritaria impactan positivamente en el potencial de apoyo legislativo. Finalmente, indican que no hay interacción entre estos dos efectos, demostrando que ambas estrategias son alternativas entre sí.},

Uno de los posibles resultados de la nueva norma sería la reducción del número de partidos en la legislatura. Al fin y al cabo, antes las coaliciones se trataban como un solo partido a efectos del reparto de escaños, lo que producía que los partidos por sí solos no alcanzaran el cociente electoral para ganar escaños. La hipótesis de esta investigación es que este efecto sí ocurrió, y de forma más aguda en los municipios más pequeños, debido a sus menores magnitudes electorales. Basándose en la estadística descriptiva e inferencial, los resultados confirman la hipótesis luego de comparar los datos electorales de 2020 en relación con las elecciones anteriores (2016 y 2012). El número de partidos con concejalas y concejales electos, y el número efectivo de partidos legislativos (NEPL) han disminuido. Además, el efecto es más pronunciado en los municipios más pequeños. Esto confirma el impacto de la nueva norma en el sistema de partidos, lo cual indica que esta tendencia también se produce a nivel nacional y estatal.},

We derive theoretical results and present simulation and empirical evidence showing that these CIs do not guard against model misspecification, and that they have poor coverage properties. We therefore recommend against using these CIs in practice. We instead propose two alternative CIs with guaranteed coverage properties under easily interpretable restrictions on the conditional expectation function. (JEL C13, C51, J13, J31, J64, J65)},

However, we ﬁnd further evidence that, in some contexts, larger councils enhance the representation of opposition parties and eﬀectively increase monitoring over the executive, attenuating the rent extraction eﬀect. Namely, in municipalities where opposition parties are typically underrepresented, the additional seat in the council is absorbed by the opposition and corruption outcomes do not worsen. In addition, only in such context, mayors are more commonly sentenced for misconduct in oﬃce by judicial authorities, whose investigations anecdotally often originates from councilors denouncing mayors to local courts. Overall, our ﬁndings show that legislature size is detrimental to corruption outcomes but less so where the representation of opposition parties improves with the enlargement of the legislature.},

Nossos resultados mostram que este efeito é substantivo: onde havia uma cadeira adicional, quase 40\% mais mulheres foram eleitas, e a probabilidade de um município eleger ao menos uma mulher aumentou em cerca de 20 pontos percentuais. Por outro lado, a explicação deste fenômeno contraria as hipóteses da literatura: especificamente, mostramos que uma cadeira a mais aumentou apenas o número de candidatos homens concorrendo, o que fragmentou suas votações e os deixou com desempenhos eleitorais piores. Deste modo, mesmo não tendo suas votações afetadas pelo número de cadeiras, mais mulheres acabaram eleitas.

            Abstract It is a commonly known on the literature of women’s political representation that a more proportional electoral system can enhance their odds of being elected. In this article, we test this hypothesis using data from more than 10,000 elections in Brazilian municipalities. Exploiting a rule enacted by the Brazilian Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) for the 2004 and 2008 elections, which created population thresholds to set the numbers of legislators, we use a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to estimate the causal effect of a unit seat increase on the women’s representation at city councils. Our results show this effect is substantive: an additional seat leads to a 40\% increase on the number of elected women, and the probability of a least one woman being elected increased by 20 percentage points. However, we do not find empirical support for the main causal mechanisms proposed in the literature. Specifically, we show that one additional seat increases only the number of running male candidates, which fragmented their vote share; as a result, even with the same performance, more women were elected.},

	abstract = {Populist parties are known to champion popular sovereignty, often leading to intensified polarisation within party systems. Simultaneously, the populist model of democracy is garnering significant support among Europeans. Yet, our understanding of how party polarisation over popular sovereignty influences populist voting remains limited, and the underlying mechanism by which citizens assess the populist model of democracy has been scarcely explored. Leveraging data from expert and opinion surveys, this article argues that highly polarised contexts heighten the perception that the populist model of democracy is underachieved, resulting in greater populist radical-right voting. Whereas support for populist radical-right parties is usually pictured as an emotional response to economic and cultural insecurities, normative evaluations of democracy are a route to populist voting. That said, they play to the hilt when activated by a high level of party polarisation over popular sovereignty.},

Yet, our knowledge of what causes party system polarization is still devel­ oping. The primary research goal is to systematically combine and test existing theories predicting levels of party system polarization across 21 established democracies. Polarization levels have generally risen since the mid1990s. A pooled model finds that characteristics of the electoral system and the party system largely deter­ mine the continuity of party system polarization. Polarization levels also appear linked to short-term factors such as citizens’ declining confidence in the economy and increasing concerns about immigration. The conclusion discusses the implications for party systems and politics in affluent democracies.},

	abstract = {In recent years, several countries have enacted numerical fiscal rules, which set limits for government expenditure, revenue, deficits and debt. According to both proponents and critics of these rules, they are a tool to depoliticize fiscal policy and perhaps the political system more broadly, by forcing political parties to adopt increasingly similar political positions. However, little empirical research has been done on whether the introduction of fiscal rules actually affects countries’ internal political life. This article explores whether fiscal rules do, in fact, cause legislative parties to adopt similar political positions, by testing the effects of fiscal rules on the level of political polarization. Using party manifestos data from 185 elections in 32 OECD countries, this article finds little robust evidence that fiscal rules independently reduce the level of political polarization within national legislatures. Contrary to popular arguments about fiscal rules and depoliticization, there is little evidence for an independent effect of fiscal rules on the variance of political parties’ positions.},

While often perceived to be negative, polarization can be an effective remedy against voter disengagement. This paper investigates two distinct, but often conﬂated mechanisms, which could explain why polarization leads to mobilization. Spatial polarization of parties diversiﬁes electoral options at the ballot, while affective polarization mobilizes based on emotional considerations. This article then shows the link between polarization and turnout across 22 European countries. The results are complemented by a difference-in-differences analysis of German local elections. However, voting results alone do not inform about the mechanism at play. Survey data is used to show that negative affect appears to be the main driver of voter participation. Party polarization thus has ambivalent consequences for democracies: It mobilizes the electorate, but its effect is driven by negative emotions.},

The present study argues that party polarization enhances the ideological consistency of belief systems and does so for the citizenry as a whole. We ﬁrst demonstrate that the more party systems are polarized on economic and sociocultural issues, the more consistently belief systems are aligned with the progressive-conservative continuum. Second, we show that ideological consistency is greater in highly polarized party systems, not only among the most politically attuned Europeans but also among those with lower levels of political sophistication. Results have implications for our understanding of citizen competence and responsiveness to elite cues in polarized party systems.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, extreme parties have gained increasing electoral success in European party systems. While this party polarization is often associated with its negative consequences, recent studies have suggested its potential beneﬁt for remobilizing the electorate by offering clear political alternatives. However, it remains unclear which groups of citizens may be mobilized by broader supply and whether this positive effect is generalizable to multiparty systems. This article contributes to this debate arguing that the system multidimensionality matters when assessing the relationship between polarization and voter turnout. Through a multilevel analysis and two studies at the aggregate and individual levels, this article provides evidence that party polarization is associated with increased turnout only when parties polarize on the cultural dimension of party competition. This effect is moderated by the party system unidimensionality and mobilizes voters at large, regardless of their level of extremism, political awareness or partisanship. These ﬁndings support previous research suggesting a ‘realignment’ of party systems, meaning that the main line of political conﬂict for parties and voters is shifting towards the cultural dimension of party competition across Europe.},

This is comparatively easy to assess in two-party systems, but capturing the pattern of affect towards multiple parties is more complex in multiparty systems. This article first discusses these challenges and then presents different ways of measuring individual-level affective polarization using likedislike scores, a widespread measure of party sympathy. Using data for 51 countries and 166 elections from five modules of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, I then show that affective polarization adds to existing concepts as a way of understanding political participation and democratic orientations. Studying affective po­ larization outside the US could therefore have important consequences for our understanding of citizen per­ ceptions of politics as well as citizen behaviour, but we need the appropriate measures to do so.},
